      <title>CHAI: Cyber Hygiene in AI enabled domestic life</title>
      <link>http://manospanaousis.com/project/chai/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly becoming part of people&amp;rsquo;s lives at home. Smart speakers, smart thermostats, security cameras with face recognition, and in the near future, brain-computer interfaces and elderly care companion robots can have considerable benefits to energy efficiency, comfort, and even health. However, &lt;strong&gt;AI also introduces new cyber security risks&lt;/strong&gt;, which users are not prepared for. When a user faces a security threat such as receiving a phishing email or visiting a watering hole website, there are often visual and behavioural cues that can raise their suspicion, and there are known cyber hygiene measures they can follow. In contrast, for AI enabled devices, such as those found in a smart home, this is rarely the case, because they are designed to be minimalist and seamless. Also, there are no equivalent cyber hygiene measures for AI security risks to advise users given the emerging nature of this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of CHAI is to help the individual protect themselves against security risks in AI enabled environments. CHAI argues that in AI enabled domestic life, new cyber hygiene measures need supporting by diagnostic tools that allow users to identify security attacks and appropriate training. This will be achieved through the following goals: (i) to identify and demonstrate the novel security breaches introduced by AI in the home; and to assess the social, psychological and neuroscientific factors that may influence an individual&amp;rsquo;s susceptibility in the context of these breaches; (ii) to employ and improve the use of methods already proposed in AI for improving the explainability of AI decisions in order to provide diagnostic information that allows users to identify AI security breaches; (iii) to develop new cyber hygiene measures, i.e. diagnostic and actionable steps that users may take to address a breach, optimised to the user and situation in terms of their cost (in usability, difficulty in implementing, mental effort, and even monetary if needing further software/hardware to be installed) using mathematical techniques; (iv) to co-design a novel cyber hygiene training programme with users of home technology that supports the use of Explainable AI while personalising and optimising the training to match each individual. Empirical research will be carried out in participating households to evaluate the effectiveness of this training approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHAI focuses on the social housing sector, which is introducing several AI initiatives, such as housing management chatbots, building maintenance bots, and smart thermostats to tackle fuel poverty. While these initiatives can result in cost cuts and facilitate property management (e.g. temperature and humidity controllers), residents have no control over these changes and often do not have the digital literacy to respond to security risks and breaches. If an AI system&amp;rsquo;s integrity or availability is breached this could affect the physical privacy of tenants (e.g. life patterns of behaviour), as well as their emotional and physical safety (e.g. temperature, electrical appliances&amp;rsquo; control). CHAI has chosen to focus on this population because of its heightened vulnerability with respect to security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With a view to deeply integrating CHAI in real-life settings, we approached leading industrial partners: (i) Gas Tag, AI developers for gas supply smart appliances in social housing, will support the examination of realistic AI applications that are currently in place or expected to be introduced in the near future in the home; (ii) Security awareness training providers, Bob&amp;rsquo;s Business, whose current clients include over 70,000 employees in the UK Government, will co-design cyber hygiene training programmes and webinars; and (iii) Housing technology sector representative, Housing Technology, will help recruit participant households and social housing associations for experiments and offer its dissemination channels in the housing sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: €2.4M (University of Greenwich share €453k).&lt;br&gt;

      <title>MERIT: A fraMEwoRk to Model and IncenTivise Cyber Security Investment Decisions</title>
      <link>http://manospanaousis.com/project/merit/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The MERIT addresses the challenge of &lt;strong&gt;how to take better cyber security investment decisions&lt;/strong&gt;. It aims at minimising cyber security risks by optimally investing its budget for cyber controls. In a multi-disciplinary approach, it utilises both &lt;strong&gt;economics and cybersecurity engineering&lt;/strong&gt; insights to significantly extend the state-of-the-art in decision support for cybersecurity spending. It combines econometrics, game theory, mathematical optimisation and cyber security engineering concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MERIT is addressing the complete cyber security management lifecycle, including asset pricing, threat-based risk assessment and optimal risk control constrained by a financial budget. The value of MERIT to practitioners is to &lt;strong&gt;increase the effectiveness of cyber security budget spending&lt;/strong&gt; as decided by Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs) and boards of directors. This effectiveness refers to both time to make a decision as well as financial savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: £60k (University of Greenwich share £48k).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Principal Investigator&lt;/strong&gt;: Manos Panaousis, &lt;strong&gt;co-Investigator&lt;/strong&gt;: Michail Chronopoulos (City University London, Cass Business School).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Partners&lt;/strong&gt;: City University, IASME consortium, Imperial College, Giess Wallis Crisp LLP.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Leading research and development on optimisation cyber security investments.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SECONDO: a Security ECONomics service platform for smart security investments and cyber insurance pricing in the beyonD 2020 netwOrking era</title>
      <link>http://manospanaousis.com/project/secondo/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://manospanaousis.com/project/secondo/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SECONDO addresses the question “How can decisions about &lt;strong&gt;cyber security investments&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cyber insurance&lt;/strong&gt; pricing be optimised?” SECONDO will support professionals who seek cyber security investments, developed to support human decision making, and a complete well-founded security strategy. This is a timely research problem, as the rapid growth of cyber-attacks is expected to continue its upwards trajectory. Such growth presents a prominent threat to normal business operations and the EU society itself. On the other hand, an interesting, well-known, finding is that an organisation&amp;rsquo;s computer systems may be less secure than a competitor&amp;rsquo;s, despite having spent more money in securing them. Budget setting, cyber security investment choices and cyber insurance, in the face of uncertainties, are highly challenging tasks with massive business implications. SECONDO aims to make impact on the operation of EU businesses who often: (i) have a limited cyber security budget; and (ii) ignore the importance of cyber insurance. Cyber insurance can play a critical role to the mitigation of cyber risk. This can be done by imposing a cost on firms&amp;rsquo; cyber risk through a premium that they have to pay and the potential for paying a smaller premium should they reduce their current cyber security risk. SECONDO has a cross-disciplinary nature, combining mathematical and engineering insights to empower innovative software. Apart from the novel research results, the project will offer a software platform to narrow the gap between theoretical understanding and practice. To achieve this, the four industrial project partners will (i) lead the part of the project where industrial needs will be entered as input to the requirements collection phase, and, (ii) provide their innovative software for risk assessment. The three academic partners will work together to (i) design and thoroughly describe the proposed methodologies, but also (ii) contribute to their software development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: €1.6M (University of Greenwich share €238k).&lt;br&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Health sector’s increasing dependence on digital information and communication infrastructures renders it vulnerable to threats to privacy and cybersecurity, especially as the theft of health data has become particularly lucrative for cyber criminals. At the same time, a breach of integrity of health data can have &lt;strong&gt;dramatic consequences for the patients affected&lt;/strong&gt;. CUREX addresses comprehensively the protection of the confidentiality and integrity of health data by producing a novel, flexible and scalable situational awareness-oriented platform. It allows a healthcare provider to assess the realistic cybersecurity and privacy risks they are exposed to and &lt;strong&gt;suggest mathematically optimal strategies for addressing these risks with safeguards tailored specifically for each business case and application&lt;/strong&gt;. CUREX is fully GDPR compliant by design. At its core, a decentralised architecture enhanced with a private blockchain infrastructure ensures the integrity of the risk assessment process and of all data transactions that occur between the diverse range of stakeholders involved. Crucially, CUREX expands beyond technical measures and places emphasis also on improving cyber hygiene through training and raising awareness activities for a healthcare institution’s personnel. Its validation focuses on the highly challenging condition of (cross-border) health data exchange, spanning &lt;strong&gt;patient cross-border mobility&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;remote healthcare&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;data exchange for research&lt;/strong&gt;. CUREX consortium will also utilise the outcomes of the well-known MyHealthMyData project in a dedicated demonstration that will use their blockchain-enabled platform which will control the actual data exchange. We envisage that CUREX will impact the European market developing one of the first blockchain platform for risk assessment management under the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Budget&lt;/strong&gt;: €4,987,825 (University of Greenwich share €311,097, University of Surrey €39,478).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Principal Investigator&lt;/strong&gt;: Manos Panaousis.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Acceptance Rate&lt;/strong&gt;: 6/46.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Leading research in optimisation of cyber controls and lead the development of the Optimal Safeguards Tool (OST) for a healthcare cybersecurity use case (Work Package leader: Risk Management for Health Data Exchange).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Games and Abstraction: The Science of Cyber Security</title>
      <link>http://manospanaousis.com/project2/gamesandabstraction/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Jul 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This proposal addresses the challenge &amp;ldquo;How do we make better security decisions?&amp;rdquo;. Specifically we propose to develop new approaches to decision support based on mathematical game theory. Our work will support professionals who are designing secure systems and also those charged with determining if systems have an appropriate level of security &amp;ndash; in particular, systems administrators. We will develop techniques to support human decision making and techniques which enable well-founded security design decisions to be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recognise that the emerging trend away from corporate IT systems towards a Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) culture will bring new challenges and changes to the role of systems administrator. However, even in this brave new world, companies will continue to have core assets such as the network infrastructure and the corporate database which will need the same kind of protection. It is certainly to be expected that some of the attacks will now originate from inside the corporate&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;firewall rather than from outside. Our team will include researchers from the Imperial College Business School who will help us to ensure that our models are properly reflecting these new threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst others have used game theoretic approaches to answer these questions, much of the previous work has been more or less ad hoc. As such the resulting&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;security decisions may be based on unsound principles. In particular, it is common to use abstractions without giving much consideration to the relationship between properties of the abstract model and the real system. We will develop a new game theoretic framework which enables a precise analysis of these relationships and hence provides a more robust decision support tool.rs and h) empowering EU-wide consensus. Within SPEAR, four proof-of-concept Use Cases are planned in order to validate and assess the implemented security and privacy tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role&lt;/strong&gt;: Postdoctoral fellowship at Queen Mary University of London; visiting researcher at Imperial College London, PIs: Pasquale Malacaria, Chris Hankin&lt;/p&gt;
