I am an Associate Professor (Reader) in the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the [University of Greenwich](https://www.gre.ac.uk/). I am also a member of the Internet of Things and Security (ISEC) Centre. Previously, I was a Senior Lecturer at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/), Senior Lecturer at the [University of Brighton](https://www.brighton.ac.uk/index.aspx), Visiting Researcher at the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), Postdoctoral Researcher at [Queen University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), and a Research and development consultant at Ubitech Technologies Ltd at the Surrey Research Park.

My main research interests involve Internet of Things security, cyber security investments, cyber insurance, game theory as applied to security, and applied cryptography.

My research is funded by the European Commission [(H2020)](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [(EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org/),
the National Cyber Security Centre [(NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), and the Research Institute in Sociotechnical Cyber Security [(RISCS)](https://www.riscs.org.uk/). I am also a member of the EPSRC Associate Peer Review College and Associate Editor of the IET Information Security.
