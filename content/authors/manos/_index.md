I am an Associate Professor (Reader) in the School of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at the [University of Greenwich](https://www.gre.ac.uk/). I am also a member of the Internet of Things and Security Centre [(ISEC)](https://www.isec.group/) and its Industry Liaison Lead.

By modelling important network and system security and privacy challenges; analysing the requirements of various stakeholders; performing technical risk assessments; and solving mathematically formulated problems using game theoretic tools, I aim at improving cyber security and privacy of systems and networks.
To address cyber risk management decisions, my research initially seeks modelling security requirements and performing cyber risk assessment (threat, control and vulnerability-based) of the underlying use cases.
Then, I employ mathematical modelling, optimisation and game theory to investigate the behaviours of defenders and attackers.
Very often, I combine cyber security science with economics and then applying mathematical methods to derive optimal ways to manage cyber risk.
As a result, my work derives optimal responses and develops decision support tools in cyber security case studies.
The above are achieved by combining cyber security engineering, mathematical optimisation, game theory complemented by machine learning capabilities.

My research is funded by the National Cyber Security Centre [(NCSC)](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/), the Research Institute in Sociotechnical Cyber Security [(RISCS)](https://www.riscs.org.uk/), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council [(EPSRC)](https://epsrc.ukri.org/), and the European Commission [(H2020)](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en). I am also a member of the EPSRC Associate Peer Review College and an Associate Editor of the IET Information Security journal.
